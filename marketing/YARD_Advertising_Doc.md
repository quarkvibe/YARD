**YARD: The Deck of Cards Workout That Built Legends**

In the yard, there are no fancy machines. No personal trainers. No excuses. Just you, the ground beneath you, and 52 cards that will test everything you've got.

YARD brings the legendary prison-style deck of cards workout to your phone. Simple, brutal, effective. The same training method that has forged some of the fittest athletes on the planet—using nothing but bodyweight and willpower.

**🃏 HOW IT WORKS**

Every card is a command. Every suit is an exercise. Flip. Count. Execute. Repeat until the deck is done.

- Draw a card
- The number is your rep count (Face cards = 10, Aces = 11)
- Complete the exercise
- Flip the next card
- No rest until the deck is finished

That's 364 reps minimum. Think you can handle it?

**💪 EXERCISE MODES**

Choose your poison:
- **PUSHUPS ONLY** - Upper body destruction
- **SQUATS ONLY** - Leg day from hell
- **SUPERSET** - Both exercises, alternating or split

**🔥 FLIP MODES**

Control your fate:
- **FRESH FISH** - One card at a time. Pure focus.
- **TRUSTEE** - See 2 cards ahead. Earned privilege.
- **OG** - See 4 cards ahead. Veteran status.
- **POD FATHER** - See the whole deck. Run your program.

**⚡ INTENSITY LEVELS**

Pick your sentence:
- **MISDEMEANOR** - Standard reps (2-10)
- **FELONY** - Heavy time (Face cards = 15)
- **LIFER** - Maximum security (Aces = 20)
