THE WORKOUT THAT BUILT LEGENDS

YARD brings the legendary Deck of Cards workout to your phone. Used by inmates, soldiers, and athletes for decades, this simple, brutal routine turns a standard 52-card deck into 300-800 reps of pure work.

HOW IT WORKS

Flip a card. Do the reps. Repeat until the deck is done.

Flip an 8 of Hearts? Thats 8 squats.
Flip a King of Spades? Thats 10-20 pushups depending on your intensity.
Race the clock. Beat your time. Get stronger.

CHOOSE YOUR SENTENCE

MISDEMEANOR - 396 reps (Ace=15, Face cards=10)
HARD TIME - 594 reps (1.5x multiplier)
LIFER - 792 reps (2x multiplier, for the truly committed)

FLIP MODES

Not all yards run the same. Pick your style:

FRESH FISH - One card at a time. Classic.
TRUSTEE - Two cards per flip. Double trouble.
OG - Keep flipping if your total is under 20 reps.
POD FATHER - Keep flipping while under 30 reps. Stack those sets.

EXERCISE OPTIONS

PUSHUPS ONLY - Every card is pushups
SQUATS ONLY - Every card is squats
SUPERSET - Red suits = squats, Black suits = pushups

SUPERSET MODES

When running supersets, choose how to mix it up:

ALTERNATING - One card squats, next card pushups, repeat
SPLIT 2 - Draw 2 cards, do one exercise each
SPLIT 4 - Draw 4 cards, split between exercises
SPLIT UNDER 20 - Keep drawing until you hit 20+ reps

10 CUSTOM DECK STYLES

Express yourself with premium card designs:
YARD, TACTICAL, LOCKUP, CASINO, NEON, CALAVERA, RONIN, KAWAII, COSPLAY, HUNTERS
