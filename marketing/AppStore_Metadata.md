### Full Description

**THE WORKOUT THAT BUILT LEGENDS**

YARD brings the legendary "Deck of Cards" workout to your phone. Used by inmates, soldiers, and athletes for decades—this simple, brutal routine turns a standard 52-card deck into 300-800 reps of pure work.

**HOW IT WORKS**

Flip a card. Do the reps. Repeat until the deck is done.

• Flip an 8 of Hearts? That's 8 squats.
• Flip a King of Spades? That's 10-20 pushups (depending on your intensity).
• Race the clock. Beat your time. Get stronger.

**CHOOSE YOUR SENTENCE**

🔹 MISDEMEANOR — 396 reps (Ace=15, Face cards=10)
🔹 HARD TIME — 594 reps (1.5x multiplier)
🔹 LIFER — 792 reps (2x multiplier, for the truly committed)

**FLIP MODES**

Not all yards run the same. Pick your style:

• FRESH FISH — One card at a time. Classic.
• TRUSTEE — Two cards per flip. Double trouble.
• OG — Keep flipping if your total is under 20 reps.
• POD FATHER — Keep flipping while under 30 reps. Stack those sets.

**EXERCISE OPTIONS**

• PUSHUPS ONLY — Every card is pushups
• SQUATS ONLY — Every card is squats
• SUPERSET — Red suits (♥️♦️) = squats, Black suits (♣️♠️) = pushups

**SUPERSET MODES**

When running supersets, choose how to mix it up:
• ALTERNATING — One card squats, next card pushups, repeat
• SPLIT 2 — Draw 2 cards, do one exercise each
• SPLIT 4 — Draw 4 cards, split between exercises
• SPLIT UNDER 20 — Keep drawing until you hit 20+ reps

**10 CUSTOM DECK STYLES**

YARD • TACTICAL • LOCKUP • CASINO • NEON • CALAVERA • RONIN • KAWAII • COSPLAY • HUNTERS

Each deck features unique artwork for face cards and backs.
