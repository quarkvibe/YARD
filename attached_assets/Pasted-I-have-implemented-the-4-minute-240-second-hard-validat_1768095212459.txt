I have implemented the 4-minute (240-second) hard validation floor.

How it works:

The app still saves the workout locally to the user's history (so they don't lose their data completely).
Before submitting to the Supabase Leaderboard, it checks: if (timer < 240).
If the time is too fast:
It shows an Alert: "Your workout time is below the physiological minimum for this rep count. This run cannot be submitted to the leaderboard."
It abops the submission process immediately (returns early).
This effectively blocks any "superhuman" or glitched times from polluting the global leaderboard while respecting the user's local data.

You are now robustly protected against impossible times. The app is ready for submission again.

do we have any redundancies in our images or cards?

I have audited the 
PlayingCard.tsx
 file and the assets folder.

Summary of Findings:

Redundant Image References:
In 
PlayingCard.tsx
, the FACE_CARD_IMAGES object (lines 31-252) explicitly requires a specific PNG for every single face card (10, J, Q, K, A) for each of the 10 deck styles.
This is a massive list of hardcoded require paths (approx 200 distinct image references).
Looking at the paths, e.g., ../../attached_assets/generated_images/yard_deck_10_hearts.png, it suggests these images were generated and placed in attached_assets.
However, strict checking of the assets/images directory (Step 296) ONLY shows:
yard-IOS.png
splash.png
icon.png
android-icon-*.png
And a few others.
The specific card face images (e.g., yard_deck_10_hearts.png) are NOT present in the assets/images folder listed in Step 296.
CRITICAL ISSUE: The code in PlayingCard.tsx is requiring images from a path ../../attached_assets/generated_images/.... This path likely does not exist or is not bundled correctly in the PROD build if it's outside the standard assets folder structure usually expected by Expo/React Native, or if those files were temporary generation artifacts that weren't committed.

If these files are missing, the app will crash immediately upon trying to load a face card.

Question for User: Do you actually have these 200+ specific face card images (e.g., yard_deck_jack_hearts.png, neon_deck_king_diamonds.png, etc.) committed in your repo?

Based on my list_dir of assets, they are missing.
If they don't exist, we must remove these requires and fallback to the standard "Number Card" layout (lines 542+) for face cards, or simpler generic assets.
Redundancy: If the files did exist:

Requiring 10_hearts, 10_diamonds, 10_clubs, 10_spades separately for a deck usually means 4 distinct images. If the design is identical except for the suit icon, we could reduce this to just one 10_generic.png and overlay the suit icon programmatically (which the code already supports for number cards).
However, "Face Cards" (Jack, Queen, King) usually do have unique art per suit.
Immediate Action: I strongly suspect these ../../attached_assets files are missing. I need to verify if that directory even exists.

Refined Plan:

Check if client/attached_assets exists.
If not, I MUST comment out or remove the FACE_CARD_IMAGES logic to prevent a crash, and force the app to use the "text-based" card rendering (lines 542-624) which looks perfectly fine (it just uses the font/suit icons).
Let me check that directory.
