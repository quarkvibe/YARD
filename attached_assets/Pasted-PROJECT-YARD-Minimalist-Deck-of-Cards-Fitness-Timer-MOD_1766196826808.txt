PROJECT: YARD — Minimalist Deck-of-Cards Fitness Timer
MODE ADD-ON: REC TIME — Competitive leaderboards + weekly challenges

GOAL
Build a brutally simple, masculine fitness app inspired by prison/military PT culture. The workout is a deck of cards: flip cards, do pushups/squats based on card value, complete the deck, track total time, and try to beat best time. The app must feel institutional (prison yard + military), minimalist, high-contrast, and disciplined. No fluff, no social feed, no influencer vibes.

CORE PRODUCT PRINCIPLES
- Extremely simple: “Flip. Move. Finish.”
- Minimal taps, minimal screens, minimal text.
- No accounts required for base app.
- REC TIME is optional competitive access; the workout stays identical, only ranking/visibility changes.
- Brand tone: masculine, institutional, understated, serious, gritty-but-clean.
- Accessibility: readable large timer, big buttons, high contrast.

APP NAME
- YARD (primary)
- “REC TIME” is the name of the competitive mode.

DESIGN LANGUAGE (UI/UX)
- Colors: matte black background (#0b0b0b), concrete gray accents, chalk white text. Optional single accent color (yard orange OR olive drab) used sparingly for Start/Finish/New Record/Rec Time indicators.
- Typography: ALL CAPS, condensed/stencil-inspired look. No rounded playful fonts.
- Texture: subtle concrete/steel scratch texture optional, but keep legibility first.
- Vibe words: YARD, COUNT, CLOCK, FINISH, LOCKED IN, DISCIPLINE.
- No emojis, no animations unless functional (e.g., card flip).

PRIMARY USER FLOW (MVP)
1) Launch -> Splash screen
2) Home screen:
   - Primary action: START WORKOUT
   - Secondary: RULESET, HISTORY, REC TIME (if enabled/available), SETTINGS
3) During workout:
   - Card shown large
   - Two suit mappings:
     - Example default: Spades/Clubs = PUSHUPS, Hearts/Diamonds = SQUATS (or user can choose)
   - Value mapping:
     - A = 1 (or 11 if ruleset selected)
     - 2-10 = face value
     - J/Q/K = 10 by default (ruleset option can set to 15/20)
     - Joker optional ruleset: burpees or “max set”
   - Big timer always visible
   - Big “FLIP” button (or swipe) reveals next card
   - Display required reps for that card prominently: “PUSHUPS x 8”
   - Simple “DONE” acknowledgement is implicit (user flips when done). No rep counting needed.
4) Finish:
   - Show total time
   - Show personal best + whether new record
   - Save run to history (date/time, ruleset, mode, total time)
   - Buttons: RUN AGAIN, VIEW HISTORY, ENTER REC TIME (if not already), SHARE (optional minimal share card image)

RULESETS (KEEP SIMPLE)
Provide a small set of presets; no complicated custom editor needed.
- STANDARD: A=1, J/Q/K=10
- HARD TIME: A=11, J/Q/K=15
- PUSHUPS ONLY: all suits pushups
- SQUATS ONLY: all suits squats
- ALTERNATE: odd cards pushups, even cards squats (optional)
Rulesets should be selectable before starting a workout.

DATA TO TRACK (LOCAL)
- Personal best time per ruleset
- History list of completed runs (timestamp, duration, ruleset, mode)
- Streaks are optional but must not guilt the user (no “you missed a day” messaging).

REC TIME (COMPETITIVE MODE) — IMPORTANT
Positioning: Not “premium” or “pro”. It’s access.
REC TIME is an optional subscription-like add-on (conceptually $1.99/month), but implement it as a feature flag/mock for MVP.

REC TIME FEATURES (HIGH LEVEL)
- Leaderboards: Global + Regional (optional) + “This Week”
- Weekly Challenge: same ruleset and constraints for everyone that week (e.g., STANDARD deck)
- Anonymous handles: user chooses a simple name; no profile pics, no bios, no chat.
- Ranking is by TIME ONLY (lower is better).
- After finishing a REC TIME run, user can submit time and see rank.
- Display: “YOUR TIME”, “YOUR RANK”, “WEEK BEST”, “GLOBAL BEST”
- Keep Rec Time UI minimalist and institutional. No social feed.

REC TIME USER EXPERIENCE
- Home screen shows a small “REC TIME” entry (locked if not enabled).
- Rec Time screen:
  - “CLOCK IN” button to start the weekly challenge (or pick from 1-2 competitive queues max).
  - Shows leaderboard list (rank, handle, time).
  - Shows user’s best Rec Time submissions.
- No spammy upsells. If locked, show one simple screen: “REC TIME IS ACCESS TO RANKINGS + WEEKLY DECK. $1.99/MO. CANCEL ANYTIME.”

SCREENS (REQUIRED)
- Splash screen
- Home
- Ruleset picker
- Workout (card + timer)
- Finish summary
- History
- Settings
- Rec Time (locked/unlocked states)
- Leaderboards (can be part of Rec Time screen)

SPLASH SCREEN (VISUAL SPEC)
- Black background with subtle concrete texture
- Center: “YARD” in stencil/condensed all-caps
- Subtext small: “FLIP. MOVE. FINISH.”
Optional: faint tally marks or card outline watermark.

APP ICON (CONCEPT OPTIONS)
Pick one and build around it:
1) Card outline with a suit symbol replaced by a pushup silhouette (stencil style)
2) Five-bar tally marks scratched/chalked on black
3) Minimal shield/patch insignia that feels military/institutional
Use high contrast, minimal details, works at small sizes.

CONTENT + COPY TONE (VERY IMPORTANT)
Short. Cold. Institutional. No hype.
Examples:
- START WORKOUT
- FLIP
- FINISH
- NEW RECORD
- CLOCK IN (Rec Time)
Avoid:
- “You got this!”
- “Crush it!”
- “Let’s go!”

NON-FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS
- App must be fast and offline-friendly for base mode.
- No sign-in required for base.
- Simple state management; deterministic deck order should be random per run with optional “seeded” mode for weekly challenge.
- Ensure timer accuracy and prevent accidental resets.
- Provide haptics/sound as optional toggles (default off or subtle).

DELIVERABLES (WHAT TO BUILD NOW)
- A working MVP with: deck logic, rulesets, timer, history, best time tracking, clean institutional UI.
- A Rec Time stub: screens + fake leaderboard data and a submission flow (later can connect to real backend).
- A clear structure so Rec Time can be wired to real auth/backend later without rewriting core workout logic.

FUTURE (NOT REQUIRED FOR MVP)
- Real backend for Rec Time leaderboards
- Anti-cheat heuristics (basic sanity checks)
- Friend squads (only if brand-safe; avoid social feed)
- Additional movement decks (burpees/core) without changing app simplicity.

OUTPUT EXPECTATION
Generate:
- A concise product plan and screen-by-screen spec
- UI component breakdown (not code-heavy)
- Data model outline (entities + fields)
- Basic navigation map
- Suggested folder structure
- Stubbed Rec Time (fake data) that can later be swapped for real API
- Keep it simple, clean, and on-brand.
